<small><Code>┃ About </code></small> <br>
&ensp;&ensp; This was created because i keep losing space for cathook stuff <br>&ensp; 
      &ensp;so i made it lightweight and very simple to run.

<br>
<small><Code>┃ Instructions for <b>Bot-Run</b> </code></small> <br>
&ensp;&ensp; Simply get <b>account.txt</b> and instead of adding it to the root directory of bot-run <br>&ensp; 
      &ensp;go to <code>webpanel/Source/Accounts/</code> and put it there.
       
<br>
<br>
       
&ensp;&ensp; Then go to MY cathook fork called <b>__cheat__</b> and add it to the root directory <code>bot-run/</code> <br>&ensp;
      &ensp;<small>or be a smartass and figure out how to make it properly work with cathook</code> and done.
       

&ensp;&ensp; Then go to terminal and type <code>./update</code> let the script to its thing then once its done and you are ready <br>&ensp;
      &ensp;type <code>./start</code> wait till it says <b>Server is ready</b> then open it in any common browser with <a href="https://localhost:8080">8080</a> <br>&ensp;
      &ensp;and there you have successfully installed my fork of <b>catbot-setup</b>, also if you want to stop <br>&ensp; 
      &ensp;the server and bots as a whole type <code>./stop</code> <b>NOTE</b> that this forcefully stops NODEJS and all its functions.
